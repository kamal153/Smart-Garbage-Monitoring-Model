# Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-Model
# Project Definition
⮚	We are living in an age where tasks and systems are fusing together with the power of IOT to have a more efficient system of working and to execute jobs quickly! With all the power at our finger tips this is what we have come up with. \
⮚	The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different systems, while providing data for millions of people to use and capitalize. \
⮚	Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. \
⮚	Urban INDIA majorly comprises of 6 major cities, namely: Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata which is the 3rd largest waste disposer in entire world. \
⮚	It is a point of major concern since 20% of which is only treated. That means, all the untreated waste gets stockpiled. \
⮚	Our knowledgeable Prime Minister has laid out a very robust plan for ‘SWACHH BHARAT ABHIYAAN’. This is a tribute to create real opportunities for the same.  \
⮚	For future enhancement, the project could be worked into incubation.

# Description
⮚	One of the main concerns with our environment has been solid waste management which impacts the health and environment of our society. \
⮚	The detection, monitoring and management of wastes is one of the primary problems of the present era. The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which can easily be avoided with our present technologies. \
⮚	This is our solution, a method in which waste management is automated. This is our IoT Garbage Monitoring system, an innovative way that will help to keep the cities clean and healthy. \
⮚	The model adheres to autonomous lid closing and opening, also autonomous bifurcation of wet and dry waste has been implemented.

# Hardware Requirements
1.	Node MCU 
2.	Ultrasonic Sensors 
3.	PIR (Passive Infrared) or Motion 
4.	Sensors 
5.	Temperature Humidity Sensor 
6.	Servo Motors 
7.	Male-to-Female Connecting Wires 

# Software Requirements 
1.	Arduino IDE 
2.	Proteus (ISIS Platform) 
3.	Thingspeak Resources 
4.  Blynk application 

# Limitations
⮚	Considering the fact that the model has been made under financial restrictions, several sensors have not been incorporated so as to optimize affordability. \
⮚	The model heavily relies on nodemcu for wifi-connectivity. \
⮚	The temperature-humidity sensor implemented is primitive to put it gently. \
⮚	Also, the clock-pulse continuously dislocates the sub-lid which results into continuous assembling and detaching everything from scratch.
